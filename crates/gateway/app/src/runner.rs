//! Application entry points: [`spawn`], [`run`], and the assembled [`Gateway`].
//!
//! [`spawn`] is the embedding seam: it loads configuration, assembles the
//! serving shell, and serves on a dedicated thread with its own tokio
//! runtime, so an embedding binary keeps its main thread. The call blocks
//! until the listener is bound - that bind is the readiness signal - and the
//! returned [`GatewayHandle`] holds the bound URL and a graceful-shutdown
//! switch. The remote routing table is published at assembly; local
//! provisioning is not on this path: the boot `LoadProfile` command runs on
//! the gateway's command queue after the bind. [`run`] is the binary
//! path: a thin wrapper that spawns, installs the
//! Ctrl-C handler, and joins. `Gateway` is the in-process assembly seam used
//! by both and by integration tests, which bind their own listener and drive
//! [`Gateway::serve`] with a caller-owned shutdown signal.
