//! PromptForge inference gateway.
//!
//! A small always-on service that accepts OpenAI-compatible chat
//! completions, holds the backend credential, resolves the request's model
//! name to a configured endpoint, forwards the request, and relays the
//! reply. It is the only process in the system with an edge to an LLM
//! backend, so the executor above it never holds a vendor key.
//!
//! What ships is an OpenAI-compatible inference surface and an admin
//! surface in two tiers, plus `GET /health`. The inference surface is
//! `POST /v1/chat/completions` (with a typed SSE relay for `stream:
//! true`), `POST /v1/embeddings`, `POST /v1/rerank`, `POST /v1/audio/speech`
//! and `GET /v1/audio/voices`, `GET /v1/models`, the Brave-backed
//! `POST /v1/tools/web_search` (`web-search` builds), the `/v1/cache` blob
//! cache (`local` builds), and, with the default-on `stt` feature, the
//! `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` batch route and
//! `WS /v1/realtime?intent=transcription` served by the speech crate. All
//! of it is bearer-authed behind model routing and the shared dominion
//! queues (`[[dominion]]`); local generative inference runs as a managed
//! `llama-server` child (`[[local_model]]`).
//!
//! The admin surface's open tier - profiles and the profile switch, the
//! status readout, the progress stream, and queue cancellation - is
//! bearer-authed and reachable from any peer the listener admits. Its
//! walled tier - the config read and shadow-write routes, env, pending
//! state, apply and revert, machine metrics, the Hugging Face proxy, the
//! cloud model sheet, reveal, `POST /shutdown`, and (in `config-ui`
//! builds) the embedded SPA at `/config/` with its `GET /auth?key=`
//! browser handoff, plus orphans, model-info, and chat-templates in
//! `local` builds - reads secrets in plaintext, writes files, or launches
//! processes, so it sits behind the shared loopback wall from
//! `shared-loopback` in every build. The one enumerable list of routes,
//! with the tier each belongs to, is the registry (`registry::all`); it
//! is logged at debug level when the router is built and swept by the
//! tests that prove each tier's wall.
//!
//! With `[server] trust_loopback` on (the default), a loopback peer
//! presenting no credential is admitted to every route unless its Fetch
//! Metadata marks a cross-origin page; `trust_loopback = false` requires
//! the bearer key from every caller. When the listener is bound to
//! loopback, every route additionally sits behind the shared
//! `Host`-authority wall, which refuses requests whose `Host` is not the
//! bound socket (the DNS-rebinding defense).
//!
//! ## Where new route code goes
//!
//! A route area gets a module named after it (`relay`, `speech`,
//! `models`, `health`); a module gets a directory at three or more
//! files. Each area module owns its own mounts behind
//! `pub(crate) fn routes() -> Router<AppState>`, and `build_router` only
//! merges the areas and applies the walls, so a new endpoint never edits
//! this crate root: the handler and its `.route()` line go in the area's
//! module, and its tests in that module's kebab `-tests.rs` sibling,
//! wired with `#[path]`.
//!
//! The admin surface is split by tier, and the tier is the directory.
//! `admin/open/` holds the bearer-authed routes any admitted peer may
//! reach; `admin/walled/` holds the routes that read secrets in
//! plaintext, write files, or launch processes, which `build_router`
//! merges once behind the shared loopback wall. A handler under
//! `walled/` takes `LoopbackCaller` where an open handler takes
//! `AuthedCaller`, so its signature states the tier its path already
//! does. A new admin route picks its directory by that question and
//! nothing else.
//!
//! Handlers read live state through the `AppState` accessors
//! (`config()`, `routing()`, `profile_name()`), never by naming the
//! lock. A handler that needs several fields atomically takes one
//! scoped `state.live.read().await`; only commands and writers take the
//! write guard.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - The listener binds and reports readiness before any model download
//!   or model process starts; slow provisioning runs afterward as a
//!   command on the gateway's queue.
//! - Clients reach credentialed providers only through the relays here,
//!   and no route hands a vendor key to Lua.
//! - The local model set is fixed for the process lifetime. Profile and
//!   local-model changes persist and report `restart_required`, and a
//!   remote routing change swaps the routing table atomically without
//!   draining.
