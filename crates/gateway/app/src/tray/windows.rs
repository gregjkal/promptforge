//! The Windows tray backend: a hidden message-only window runs the main
//! thread's win32 message loop while serving stays on the gateway thread.
//!
//! tray-icon delivers its callbacks on this thread from inside the loop's
//! dispatch, and muda's menu items are `!Send` (they hold
//! `Rc<RefCell<_>>` state), so a callback cannot touch menu state ahead of
//! the crate's automatic menu show. The backend therefore disables both
//! auto-shows and opens the menu itself from the loop after re-probing the
//! installed Workshop - the ordering the tray idiom needs - and the
//! callbacks only forward a [`TrayEvent`] into the loop with a
//! `PostMessageW` wake, never launching processes, opening browsers, or
//! touching the registry.
