//! The macOS tray backend: the `NSApplication` run loop owns the main
//! thread while serving stays on the gateway thread spawned by
//! [`crate::spawn`].
//!
//! Process shape: the gateway ships as the principal executable of its own
//! `PromptForge Gateway.app`, whose Info.plist (`packaging/Info.plist`)
//! sets `LSUIElement`. A development build runs as a bare executable with
//! no Info.plist, so the early `setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` call in
//! [`run`] still keeps the daemon out of the Dock there, and it runs
//! before any other AppKit initialization. The tray itself is built on the
//! first pass of the run loop (a zero-delay one-shot timer), because
//! status-item construction before the loop runs is the classic source of
//! invisible trays.
//!
//! Menu discipline: muda 0.19.3 does not contain the use-after-free fix
//! for `set_menu` while the menu is displayed
//! (<https://github.com/tauri-apps/muda/issues/328>, fixed by
//! <https://github.com/tauri-apps/muda/pull/361>, merged 2026-07-30 but
//! unreleased), so - as on Windows - every state change mutates
//! the retained `MenuItem` handles in place and `set_menu` is never
//! called after construction.
//! There is no double-click gesture: the menu opens on mouse-down, so
//! Settings is simply the first enabled item. tray-icon delivers the
//! mouse-down `Click` event before it performs the status-item click that
//! opens the menu, which is the one pre-display hook macOS offers for
//! re-probing the Workshop and login states.
//!
//! Launch at Login goes through `SMAppService.mainApp`, which registers
//! the containing bundle's principal executable. Inside another bundle,
//! such as a gateway copied into the workshop's, that principal is not the
//! gateway, so registration could open the workshop window at every login -
//! the exact annoyance the `--login` design exists to avoid. The store
//! therefore exists only when the gateway is its own bundle's principal
//! executable, as in the shipped gateway .app; otherwise the menu item is
//! disabled. Registration also needs a signed bundle, so an unsigned
//! build's registration failure is reported and rolled back.
